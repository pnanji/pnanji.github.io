				<h2>What to do After an Auto Accident</h2>
				<h5>Find out best practices to make sure you're prepared in case you're ever in an accident</h5>
				<div>
					<h6>What information should I obtain?</h6>
					<p>It is important that you seek immediate medical attention if you are seriously injured in an automobile accident. After everyone is out of danger and any medical and police help has been summoned, obtain the following: 
						<ul class="label">
							<li>The full names of the drivers of all of the vehicles involved.</li>
							<li>The driver's license numbers and addresses of all of the drivers.</li>
							<li>If any of the driver's appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, notify police or other emergency personnel immediately.</li>
							<li>The full names & addresses of any passengers, pedestrians, witnesses or other parties involved.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h6>Should I call the police?</h6>
					<p>Yes! It is important to contact the police immediately if you are involved in an accident. Doing so will provide proof of the accident, and will allow for an immediate investigation of the scene of the accident. In addition, police will take statements of witnesses, and will examine the other driver to check for drug or alcohol use. The police can also be valuable witnesses to your injury at the scene, and they can assist in securing an admission of fault from the negligent driver.</p>
					<p>Even in minor accidents, resist the temptation to "keep things simple" by "settling up" with the other driver on the spot. You should make sure that you have not suffered injuries which do not develop symptoms until days or even weeks after the accident, and you should always consult with your doctor and an experienced attorney to make sure that you are aware of all of the avenues of recovery available to you.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h6>Do I need to contact an attorney?</h6>
					<p>Not always. After leaving the scene of an accident, or while still there if you are safely able, you should immediately contact an attorney who is experienced in handling personal injury matters. Even in minor accidents, resist the temptation to “keep things simple” by “settling up” with the other driver on the spot. You should make sure that you have not suffered injuries which do not develop symptoms until days or even weeks after the accident, and you should always consult with your doctor and an experienced attorney to make sure that you are aware of all of the avenues of recovery available to you.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h6>Should I contact my own insurance company?</h6>
					<p>Most auto insurance companies require their policyholders to promptly report every auto accident. Your insurance company will want to gather all of the basic information concerning the accident for its records&mdash;whether you are at fault or not. Sometimes the insurance company will want your authorization to make a recorded statement concerning the accident. We suggest that if you or your passengers were injured in the accident, or if you believe the insurance company might try to claim you are not covered or you have any concerns about the adequacy of your coverage, you should contact an attorney before you go any further, and certainly before you give the insurance company permission to record your conversation (<span class="smallCaps">note</span>: You should never give a statement to the other driver's insurance company without consulting with an attorney). However, bear in mind that failure to provide information to your insurance company on a timely basis&mdash;your policy will set forth how quickly you must notify the company&mdash;could result in loss of coverage for the accident, without it constituting bad faith by the insurer.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h6></h6>
					<p></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h6>Should I go to the doctor?</h6>
					<p>Never hesitate to get checked out by medical professionals even when you feel okay. Many times the onset of physical complaints begins 12 to 24 hours after an accident. Even if you did walk away only feeling "shaken up" after being rear-ended by a truck, tomorrow morning when you get out of bed it may be a different story.</p>
					<p>It is also important that you get medical attention if you feel any pain or discomfort. Many people hope that their pain will go away on its own and wait for several weeks before finally succumbing and going to the doctor. Waiting to get treatment is not only not good for your health&mdash;it will hurt your chances of obtaining an appropriate settlement for your injuries, since there will be no medical record of your injury at the time of the accident. Seeing a doctor following the accident will insure a preliminary diagnosis and perhaps minimize the discomfort and future treatment you may need later. Follow the doctor's advice to the letter and never miss a doctor's appointment. Do not substitute your judgment for that of an experienced medical professional. If you do, it will be used against you in court.</p>
					<p>If you have been in a serious accident, chances are that someone has already made a record of what has happened to you. There already is a police report, an on-the-job worker's compensation report, or the like. If your condition required immediate medical care, hospital records will confirm your injuries. Make sure you promptly follow-up with treatment from your regular doctor or an appropriate specialist following hospitalization.</p>

				<h2>How is Fault Determined</h2>
				<h5>Learn more about how courts decide who is at fault in an auto accident</h5>
				<div>
					<p>Automobile accidents are generally decided using the law of negligence. A person who negligently operates a vehicle may be required to pay any damages caused by their negligence, either to person or property. Generally, people who operate automobiles must exercise “reasonable care under the circumstances.” Failure to use reasonable care is the basis in most lawsuits for damages caused by an automobile accident. Courts look to a number of factors in determining whether a driver was negligent. Some examples of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Driving too fast or too slow</li>
							<li>Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol</li>
							<li>Failing to signal while turning</li>
							<li>Disregarding weather or traffic conditions</li>
							<li>Disobeying traffic signs or signals</li>
							<li>Failing to drive on the right side of the road</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>A driver may also be liable for an accident caused by intentional or reckless conduct. A driver who is reckless is one who drives unsafely, with willful and wanton disregard for the probability that the driving may cause an accident.</p>
					<p>In certain cases, accidents are caused by factors unrelated to the conduct of any particular driver. For example, under the law of product liability, an automobile manufacturer or supplier may be responsible for injuries caused by a defect in the automobile, or a component of the automobile, as in the Firestone tire litigation. A products liability suit is a lawsuit brought against the seller of a product for selling a defective product that caused physical injury to a consumer or user. If a manufacturer of a product creates a defective product — either in developing, designing or labeling the product — the manufacturer is liable for any injures the product causes, regardless of whether or not the manufacturer was negligent.</p>
					<p>In another example, if a mechanic fails to properly repair a vehicle, and the failure causes an accident, the person who improperly repaired the automobile, and the repair shop, may be liable for injuries sustained. Other factors such as poorly maintained roads and malfunctioning traffic control signals can contribute to the cause. Improper design, maintenance, construction, signage, lighting or other highway defect, as well as improper striping on the road's passing lanes, a sharp obstruction or problem with the roadway that limits the drivers' vision, or poorly placed trees and utility poles can also cause serious accidents. Finally, if an accident is caused by an intoxicated driver, a bar or social host may be liable for damages sustained if they served an obviously intoxicated guest, who then drives and causes an accident.</p>

				<h2>Auto Insurance Coverage</h2>
				<h5>Read about the different types of insurance coverage and learn which ones you may need.</h5>
				<div>
					<p>There are two categories of auto insurance - first party coverage and third party coverage. First party coverage covers you and your property (such as medical expenses, damage to your vehicle and the insurance company's duty to defend you in the event that you are sued as the result of your operation of a vehicle, etc.). Third party coverage is for your responsibility to pay for injury caused to other people (and vice versa), whether in your vehicle, or another vehicle involved in the accident. The coverage (and its exclusions) is set forth in your insurance policy. In exchange for the payment of a premium, the insurance company promises to provide compensation in the event of certain occurrences. Though a full recitation of insurance coverage and laws would occupy several large text volumes, the following is brief synopsis of the most typical coverage and issues. Among the various types of insurance coverage which may apply are the following:</p>
					<p><b>Liability Insurance</b></p>
					<p>As stated, this type of insurance is required by law.(N.R.S. § 60-534.) The liability portion of an insurance policy is specifically for defending and settling any claims or paying any judgments rendered against the insured in an automobile negligence claim. If you are injured by the negligence of a defendant, we will make a claim under the bodily injury liability coverage of the negligent defendant's insurance policy. Liability coverage is not health insurance, and it is not designed to pay for your medical bills as they are incurred. It is designed for a one time settlement or payment for all of your damages. Liability insurance minimums required by law in Nebraska are:
						<ul>
							<li>Twenty-five thousand dollars for bodily injury or death of one person in any one accident.</li>
							<li>Fifty thousand dollars for bodily injury or death of two or more persons in one accident, not exceed the per-person limits above.</li>
							<li>Twenty-five thousand dollars for injury to or harm to property of others in one accident.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Lawsuits in Nebraska must be filed against the negligent driver and may not also name the insurance carrier as a defendant. In fact, the jury is not allowed to know that there is insurance coverage available on the defendant. If the jury renders a verdict in excess of the defendant's liability policy limit, the defendant is then personally liable out of his or her own assets for the additional amount.</p>
					<p><b>Medical Payments (Med&ndash;Pay) Coverage</b></p>
					<p>When purchasing automobile insurance for yourself, you may seek to include several additional type of coverage other than liability insurance.  One of these types of coverage is called medical payments coverage.</p>
					<p>Medical payments coverage is a form of health coverage called by various terms, including "med-pay," "personal injury protection (PIP)," or on occasion "economic loss protection benefits." This coverage is available to the insured driver (the individual who holds the policy which includes med-pay coverage) and any passengers in the insured's vehicle for injuries sustained, regardless of the fault of the driver. It is important to note that the insurance policy of the negligent party does not pay med-pay or PIP benefits to an injured plaintiff. These benefits are limited to the driver or passengers in the insured vehicle, regardless of fault. The plaintiff looks to his own insurance policy or the policy on the vehicle in which he was a passenger for med-pay or PIP benefits.</p>
					<p>The amount of med-pay benefits which may be paid to any individual is determined by reference to the policy limit for this particular type of coverage, as stated in the insurance policy declarations sheet for the person who purchased the coverage.</p>
