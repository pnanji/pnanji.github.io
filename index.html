				<p class="largetype">We’re a dedicated team of lawyers, legal assistants and bookeepers based out of Omaha, Nebraska. Our firm was started in 1981 and our commitment to our clients and steadfast integrity has allowed us to continue representing families from all over the United States for more than 30 years. Like the majority of sales people, I visit a huge number of clients and prospects every month, some end up buying some do not, but every single one of them has my business card. I attend business breakfasts, seminars and other networking event in my search for new contacts and ultimately new business, each person I meet also gets a business card.</p>
